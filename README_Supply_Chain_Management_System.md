# 🏭 Supply Chain Management System

A **Java-based Supply Chain Management System** designed to streamline product movement, supplier coordination, and inventory tracking across multiple stages of the supply chain. The project leverages **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, and **MySQL** to build a scalable, secure, and efficient backend system.

## 🔹 Features
- Manage suppliers, products, and inventory across multiple warehouses  
- Track shipments, purchase orders, and delivery statuses in real time  
- Role-based authentication and access control using **Spring Security**  
- API-driven architecture enabling integration with external logistics systems  
- Event-driven communication using **Kafka** for supplier and inventory updates  
- Containerized deployment with **Docker**  

## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring Security  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka  
- **Architecture:** Microservices  
- **Tools:** Maven, Docker  

## 🔹 Key Highlights
- Applied **Microservices and System Design principles** for modular scalability  
- Improved data consistency and reliability using **Kafka-based event streaming**  
- Optimized API performance and database queries for faster data synchronization  
- Built secure endpoints following **RESTful design and SOLID principles**  

## 🔹 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
